# My LeetCode Solutions in Swift

A collection of my solutions to LeetCode problems as I learn Swift programming.

## About This Project

This repository documents my journey of learning Swift through solving LeetCode problems. My focus is on:

- Writing clear, readable code rather than clever one-liners
- Understanding and implementing efficient algorithms
- Improving my problem-solving skills in Swift

While I'm sharing these solutions publicly, this is primarily a personal learning project.

## Goals

- Enhance my Swift programming skills
- Build a solid understanding of common algorithms and data structures
- Track my progress in solving LeetCode problems
- Create a reference for my future self and potentially help other learners

## Project Structure

Each solution is organized in its own file, named after the corresponding LeetCode problem. The code includes comments that explain the thought process and highlight any key concepts used. Additionally, a set of tests is provided for each problem to ensure the validity of the solution.
